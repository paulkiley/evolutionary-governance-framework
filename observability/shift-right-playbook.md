# Shift Right Playbook

This playbook provides guidance on closing the feedback loop through observability and experimentation.

## Monitoring

Implement comprehensive monitoring using metrics, logs and traces.  Ensure that all services export standard metrics and correlate them with user journeys.

## Experiments and Canary Releases

Use canary releases and feature flags to safely test changes in production.  Observe key metrics to determine whether a rollout should proceed or be rolled back.

## Incident Analysis

Treat incidents as learning opportunities.  Conduct postâ€‘incident reviews and capture insights as ADRs or updates to existing decisions.
