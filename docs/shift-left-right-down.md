# Shift Left, Shift Right and Shift Down

The EGF implements a holistic philosophy across the software lifecycle using three complementary “shifts”:

## Shift Left

Shift Left emphasises building quality, security and performance into the system from the earliest stages of design.  Static analysis, code review, and threat modelling occur before code is merged, preventing defects rather than fixing them later.

## Shift Right

Shift Right focuses on closing the feedback loop by observing real‑world behaviour.  Monitoring, logging, canary releases and user feedback provide the data needed to validate assumptions and inform the next iteration.

## Shift Down

Shift Down encapsulates the automation of both Shift Left and Shift Right practices into a cohesive platform.  By reducing manual toil, it ensures that disciplined practices are followed by default and that developers can focus on solving higher‑order problems.
