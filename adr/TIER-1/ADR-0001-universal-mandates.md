# ADR-0001 – Universal Mandates

### Status

Accepted

### Context

All projects within the EGF must adhere to a core set of non‑negotiable mandates to ensure consistency and quality.

### Decision

1. Every project must include a `README.md` that documents the project’s purpose and how to get started.
2. Each repository must include a suitable license and a code of conduct.
3. Static code analysis and formatting are mandatory via linters, formatters and type checkers (see ADR‑0002).

### Consequences

These mandates create a consistent baseline across all projects.  They may introduce additional overhead for small experiments but ensure that quality practices are ingrained from the start.
