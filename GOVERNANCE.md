# Project Governance

The Evolutionary Governance Framework is maintained by a core team of maintainers.  Architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs and follow a tiered rule system.  Contributions are discussed via issues and pull requests; decisions with broad impact may require an RFC (see `governance/rfc/template.md`).

## Decision Making

* **Tier 1 ADRs:** Require consensus from all maintainers.
* **Tier 2 ADRs:** Developed alongside archetype scaffolds; reviewed and approved by maintainers.
* **Tier 3 ADRs:** Determined by project teams; must not contradict Tier 1 or Tier 2 decisions.

For changes that affect governance itself, open an issue and propose amendments via pull request.
