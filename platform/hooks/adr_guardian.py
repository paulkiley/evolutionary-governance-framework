ADR Guardian hook.

This script is intended to be invoked from a pre-commit hook or CI job.
It scans commit diffs for changes that may violate conceptual ADRs (Tier 3).
The implementation is a stub; in a real system it would use AI or rule‑based
checks to identify potential deviations from project architecture.
