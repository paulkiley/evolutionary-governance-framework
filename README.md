# Evolutionary Governance Framework (EGF)

This repository contains the **Evolutionary Governance Framework (EGF)**, a system for building elite, resilient and scalable software systems.  The EGF integrates codified architectural decision records (ADRs), automation, and an AI partnership model to ensure that high‑quality software is the easiest path forward.

## Overview

The EGF provides:

- A tiered ADR system capturing universal mandates (Tier 1), archetype‑specific best practices (Tier 2) and project‑specific decisions (Tier 3).
- Archetype scaffolds for web services, CLI tools and data science projects, using cookiecutter‑style templates.
- A platform for static code analysis, pre‑commit hooks, continuous integration and policy enforcement via Open Policy Agent.
- Documentation covering the EGF proposal, the rule tier system, the Shift Left/Right/Down mindset and the AI partnership model.

For the full background and rationale, see **docs/egf-proposal.md**.
